## WebSocket Integration

TimeService includes WebSocket support for real-time data updates. The WebSocket server is integrated with the HTTP server to handle connection upgrades and provide real-time capabilities to clients.

    WebSocket Features:
        Broadcast messages to all connected clients.
        Handle incoming messages from clients and respond as needed.
        Maintain active connections and manage client disconnections.

To use WebSocket features, ensure that your client supports WebSocket connections and can handle messages as per your applicationâ€™s requirements.
